# Coursera Capstone Project

This Shiny app was developed for the Capstone Project of the Johns Hopkins Coursera Data Science Specialization. This Capstone Project is designed in partnership with Swiftkey.

The goal of the project is to build a predictive text model combined with a shiny app that will predict the next word as the user types a sentence. All text mining and natural language processing was done using R packages.

The Usage Of The Application

"NULL" is displayed at 'The predicted Word' textbox, by default.

Enter a partially sentence to begin the next word prediction.

Next word predicted is shown at 'The Predicted Word' textbox.

The information about n-gram backoff algorithm used to predict is shown in a textbox.
